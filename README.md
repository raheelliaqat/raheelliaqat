🎮 About Me

I'm Raheel Liaqat, a passionate Unity Game Developer with 3+ years of experience in gameplay programming, physics simulations, and advanced game mechanics.
🛠️ My Expertise in Game Development:

✔️ Gameplay Mechanics & Systems Design – Crafting engaging mechanics that make games feel intuitive, responsive, and fun. From character controllers to enemy AI behaviors, I ensure smooth, immersive gameplay.

✔️ Physics Programming – Implementing realistic physics-based interactions using Rigidbodies, Colliders, Forces, Impulses, and Raycasting. Proficient in creating:

    Custom movement and jumping physics for platformers and FPS games.
    Projectile motion for realistic bullets, arrows, and throwing mechanics.
    Ragdoll physics for dynamic character reactions and death animations.
    Advanced collision handling to prevent tunneling and unwanted physics glitches.

✔️ Vectors & Transformations – Deep understanding of vector math in game development for:

    Smooth player movement and steering behaviors using Lerp, Slerp, and Quaternion rotations.
    Trajectory calculations for weapons, projectiles, and physics-based objects.
    Procedural animations and inverse kinematics for character movements.
    Efficient enemy AI pathfinding using NavMesh and custom A algorithms*.

✔️ Optimization & Performance – Profiling and optimizing games for smooth frame rates across devices by reducing draw calls, physics overhead, and memory leaks.

✔️ API Integration & Multiplayer – Experienced in Firebase (Firestore, Authentication, Analytics), Ad Integrations (AdMob, Unity Ads, IronSource), and Google Play Asset Delivery. Exploring multiplayer development using Photon PUN and Mirror.

I’m always looking to push the limits of interactive experiences by combining physics, AI, and smooth game feel! 🚀
